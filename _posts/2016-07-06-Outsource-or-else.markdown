My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1676596926">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Outsource or Else! How a VP of Software Saved His Company is a technical novel written in the style of The Phoenix Project about how the VP of engineering, Jason, at the company “Shapeshift” is tasked with delivering a new product with a completely unrealistic schedule to meet the demands of investors. This leads the company to outsource software development. I found the plot to be entertaining and enjoyed how the author uses a side story about a landscaping project at Jason’s home which ends up being a prime example of how to fail at outsourcing work. I have to admit, as a software developer myself I was a bit skeptical about a book on outsourcing software development. However, I found the book to be entertaining and was able to gain some business perspective on when it might make sense to contract a third-party for help.
