I discovered geojson.io a few weeks ago and have found it to be very helpful in generating polygon samples for testing my data integration applications. Geojson.io enables you to easily create polygon shapes on a map from your browser and export to your desired format: GeoJSON, TopoJSON, KML, CSV, WKT, and Shapefile.


It appears that GitHub also renders the saved GeoJSON to a map by default which is nice for embedding on a blog.:-) Thank you GitHub!
