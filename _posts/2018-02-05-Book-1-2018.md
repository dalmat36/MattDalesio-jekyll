The book was not exactly what I was expecting however I still found some value in it. It was more of a narriative of Dan's career for ABC and how he was able to use meditation and mindfullness to overcome the negativity of his own mind to become 10% happier. If you are looking for a book that immediately begins discussing meditation and mindfullness then this is not that book. 

My Rating: 3 of 5
