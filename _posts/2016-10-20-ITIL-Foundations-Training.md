This week I attended the ITIL Foundations training provided by [Jim Bolton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimbolton1) of [ProPoint Solutions Inc.](http://www.propointsolutions.com/)  My motivation for taking the training was to gain a basic understanding of the framework that is guiding 
the university's [IT Transformation (ITX)](http://smo.psu.edu/it-transformation/) initiative and more specifically learn more about my role as a database developer 
as it fits into the Service Transition lifecycle. I was pleased that one of the first questions asked was if anyone has read the [Phoenix Project](http://amzn.to/2egEYvZ) as it is one of my faviorite books on 
delivering business value using IT. As a person that came from the electronics design world I enjoy discussing the parallels of the service delivery and "DevOps" to the manufacturing world.
