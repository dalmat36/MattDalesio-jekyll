In my spare time I have been learning how to create cross-platform games using [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/). Sparty Bros is the
sample game built during the Coursera course: [Game Development for Modern Platforms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamedev-platforms) 
by Brian Winn <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>[@winnBrian](https://twitter.com/winnbrian) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I have found this
course to be very helpful in creating a functional game with a menu system. It has given me a great starting point for creating my own games.
If you have an interest in game development I would highly recommend checking out the courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development). 

Below is the WebGL version of the game which is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket.
