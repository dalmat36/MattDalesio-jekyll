In my spare time I have been learning how to create cross-platform games using [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/). Sparty Bros is the
sample game built during the Coursera course: [Game Development for Modern Platforms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamedev-platforms) 
by Brian Winn <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>[@winnBrian](https://twitter.com/winnbrian) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I have found this
course to be very helpful in creating a functional game with a menu system. It has given me a great starting point for creating my own games.
If you have an interest in game development I would highly recommend checking out the courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development). 

Upon loading the user is presented with a basic main menu screen where they can choose to start a new game, select a level, or read more about the game.

The Sparty Bros project game contains one very simple playable level. The objective of the game is to collect all of the coins and obtain the rose artifact to
trigger the game victory and end of the level.

<p>If you are on a laptop or desktop you can try playing the WebGL version of the game by clicking the button below. (Game hosted in AWS S3 bucket)</p>
