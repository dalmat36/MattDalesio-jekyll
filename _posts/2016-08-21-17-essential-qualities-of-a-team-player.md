I started a new position in the Outreach and Information Technology (OIT) department at Penn State’s Outreach and Online education (World Campus) back in June and was introduced to the book “The 17 Essential Qualities of a Team Player” at one of our monthly team meetings. One of the goals of the team for 2016 and beyond is the continuous improvement of soft skills and teamwork. <br>“The 17 Essential Qualities of a Team Player” by John Maxwell is short but informative read on how to be a better team player. I was pleased to find that utilize some of the techniques already and discovered some that will be helpful. One of the points that really stuck with me was the story about an individual that removed a marble from a jar each Saturday to remind himself that you can’t choose how much time you get but you can choose what you do with it so make every action count. <br>
